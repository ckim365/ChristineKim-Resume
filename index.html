        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre - Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">A flexible and adaptable Pre-Business freshman student (3.48 GPA) at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) originally born in the San Fernando Valley, California. In my free time, I enjoy building LEGOs for the creative challenge of designing and puzzling complex structures and dancing to genres surrounding K-Pop and Hip-Hop. I began to find interest in the business field because of my family members who are mostly involved in different aspects of a business - an accountant at a biotech company, head of a small-business Korean magazine company, and one of the heads of a skincare company called Hanacure. Although I do not have any professional work experience, I am proficient in Korean, Java, and Python. I gained valuable skills and demonstrated my commitment to leadership and community service through my involvement in various clubs, organizations, and extracurricular activities in high school: Knights and Ladies, Korean Club, and Cheerleading team. I am seeking an internship opportunity at Girls Crew to further develop my business marketing and analytical skills.<br><br>

        Attended and graduated from Grover Cleveland High School under the Humanities Magnet Program (Core), receiving the High Honor Roll as valedictorian (4.2 GPA). Served my community with enthusiasm and was accepted into the Knights and Ladies organization, which focuses on engaging students with staff, faculties, and parents to create welcoming, organized events and environments for other students. Managed Korean Club under the President position to shine awareness, educate diverse audiences, and set a safe place for many Korean American students to express their identities and underlying factors that are covered by recent “trends”. Auditioned each year for Cleveland High School’s cheerleading team and became a member for 3+ years. In my fourth year, I was officially appointed as the team captain where I taught dances, choreographed, performed, and collaborated with students, staff, and faculties for pep rallies and basketball half-time shows. Currently, I am attending a club called CSA, the Chinese Student Association, to be educated in cultural awareness and sensitivity that can help build stronger relationships to avoid misunderstandings. As “after-socials” are hosted after general meetings, I am able to develop strong networking skills and build relationships to connect with like-minded individuals.<br><br>

        The skills and experiences gained in these extracurricular activities allowed me to inherit communication, leadership, cultural awareness, analytical, and project management skills. From being able to clearly express ideas, listen actively, work collaboratively to achieve a common goal, make strategic decisions, and plan to execute events and activities, I plan to use these skills to build positive relationships with (international) clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. With my personal qualities of being reliable, detail-oriented, and outgoing with a positive attitude, I aspire to pursue a career in the business field in the near future, specifically as a business coordinator or market research analyst. I am motivated to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to drive innovation, promote sustainability, improve efficiency, and contribute to job creation and opportunities to others. By identifying customer needs and trends through market research, I will help businesses develop solutions that meet those needs. Thus, I am confident to help make informed, essential decisions based on data and insights regarding budgeting, time management, and coordination.
